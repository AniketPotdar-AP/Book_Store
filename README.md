# Book Store Application

The BookStore application is a modern, feature-rich web platform designed to provide users with a seamless and intuitive online book shopping experience. Built with a robust stack that includes React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, Node.js, and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data management, this application ensures high performance, scalability, and maintainability. Additionally, DaiyuUI, an extension of Tailwind CSS, is utilized to deliver elegant and consistent user interfaces.
